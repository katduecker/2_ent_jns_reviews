\subsection{Experimental Procedure \& Apparatus}
\noindent The MEG data were recorded using a MEGIN Triux system housed in a magnetically shielded room (MSR; Vacuumschmelze GmbH \& co., Hanau, Germany). Neuromagnetic signals were acquired from  204 orthogonal planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometers at 102 sensor positions.  Horizontal and vertical EOG, the cardiac ECG signals, stimulus markers as well as luminance changes recorded by a photodiode were acquired together with the  neuromagnetic signal. The data were lowpass filtered online at 330 Hz and sampled at 1000 Hz. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRIs), for later co-registration with the MEG data, were acquired using a 3 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma whole-body scanner (Siemens AG, Muenchen, Germany), TE = 2 ms, and TR = 2 s). For two subjects, the T1-weighted images obtained in previous experiments, using a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva Scanner (Philips North America Corporation, Andover, USA), were used (scanned at the former Birmingham University Imaging Centre).  Participants were invited to two separate sessions during which the MEG data and  the anatomical images were acquired, respectively. Whenever possible, the MEG recording preceded the MRI scan; otherwise, the MEG session was scheduled at least 48 hours after the MRI session to avoid any residual magnetization from the MRI system. Volunteers were requested to remove all metal items (e.g. jewelry) before entering the MSR. To enable later co-registration between MRI and MEG data, four to five head-position-indicator (HPI) coils were attached to the participants' foreheads. Along with the position of the coils, three fiducial landmarks (nasion, left and right tragus) and over 200 head-shape samples were digitized using a Polhemus Fastrak (Polhemus, Colchester, USA). Following the preparation, the participants were seated in upright position under the dewar, with orientation set to 60$^{\circ}$. The MEG experiment consisted of fifteen blocks lasting 4 min 30 s each. Participants were offered breaks every $\sim$20 min but remained seated. At the beginning of each of these recording blocks, subjects were instructed to sit with the top and backside of their head touching the sensor helmet. 
The positions of the HPI coils relative to the sensors was gathered at the beginning of each recording block, but not continuously. The MEG experiment lasted $\sim$75 min in total.

\subsection{Rapid photic stimulation} \noindent
Stimuli were presented using a Propixx lite projector (VPixx Technologies Inc, Saint-Bruno, QC Canada) which allows refresh rates of up to 1440 Hz. To achieve this high-frequency mode, the projector separates the screen (initial resolution: $1920\times1080$ pixels) into quadrants and treats them as separate frames, resulting in a display resolution of $960\times540$ pixels. The RGB color codes for each quadrant, viz. red, green and blue, are converted to a gray scale, separately for each frame and color, and presented consecutively within one refresh interval. The twelve frames are presented at a refresh rate of 120 Hz, resulting in 12$\times$120 Hz = 1440 Hz. This approach allows to drive the luminance of each pixel with high temporal precision, allowing for smooth sinusoidal modulations, reducing unwanted harmonics (see Figure \ref{fig:paradigm}C,D). In this study, we applied rapid rhythmic stimulation at frequencies ranging from 52 to 90 Hz in 2 Hz increments.

\subsection{Experimental Paradigm} \noindent
Stimuli were created in MATLAB 2017a (The MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA, USA) and presented using the Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 \citep{brainard1997psychophysics}.
\paragraph{Conditions} The experiment consisted of two conditions that will be referred to as the \RFTonly and the \gammaRFT condition, respectively. Each trial began with a one-second interval, in which a central white fixation cross was presented on a dark gray background. \textcolor{red}{In the \RFTonly trials, a photic drive in the shape of a circular patch of diameter 2.62$^{\circ}$ was presented for 2 s. Therefore, the patch's luminance was modulated sinusoidally at frequencies between 52 and 90 Hz (Figure \ref{fig:paradigm}A). To minimise the visibility of the flicker, the mean luminance of the patch was matched with the background (33\% luminance, RGB [84 84 84]).} Frequencies were randomized and balanced across trials. The patch was centered on the fixation cross, such that it was presented both foveally and parafoveally.  Each trial ended with a two-second interval in which only the fixation cross was presented. In the \gammaRFT condition, the baseline interval was followed by a 2 s presentation of a moving grating stimulus that has been shown to reliably elicit gamma oscillations in visual cortex \citep[e.g.][]{hoogenboom2006localizing,hoogenboom2010visually,muthukumaraswamy2013visual,tan2016meg}. The stimulus was the same size as the patch (2.62$^{\circ}$) and had a spatial frequency of 9.1 rings/$^{\circ}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:paradigm}B); \textcolor{red}{the individual rings' width was 0.11$^{\circ}$}. \textcolor{red}{The rings contracted towards the center of the screen with a velocity of 0.56 $^{\circ}$/s, i.e. $\sim$4.5 cycles/s.} In the subsequent 2 s interval, \textcolor{red}{the gratings were flickered at the respective frequencies, by sinusoidally modulating the luminance of the entire stimulus with each screen refresh.} The trial concluded with a 2 s interval in which the concentric moving circles remained on screen without photic stimulation. To keep the overall brightness of the stimulation similar between conditions, the luminance of the circular patch in the \RFTonly condition ranged from 0 to 66\% (of the projector's maximum), while the brightness of the gratings in the \gammaRFT ranged from 33 to 99\%. \textcolor{red}{The resulting contrast between the gray and black rings, of 66\%, has been previously demonstrated to induce clearly identifiable gamma oscillations \citep{self2016effects}. The range of the photic drive, i.e. the difference between peak and trough, estimated based on the projector's maximum luminance, was 339 lumens.} The flicker was replicated in the lower right corner of the screen, to acquire the stimulation signal with a photodiode. \textcolor{red}{The rationale of this design was to investigate if and how the resonance properties of the visual system change when an endogenous gamma oscillator in visual cortex is activated; and whether the flicker response modulates the ongoing oscillatory activity. Studying these two phenomena in the \gammaRFT condition required a characterization of both the gamma oscillations and flicker response in isolation. The former was achieved by presenting the gratings without the flicker. To extract the flicker response, we aimed to avoid any gamma-band activity in visual cortex. This was implemented by applying the flicker to a texture-free, invisible patch. Given the filter properties of the visual system \citep[see][for review]{cormack2005computational}, we were further interested in identifying an upper limit of the frequencies inducing reliable responses. As we expect these results to guide future studies employing the rapid flicker for frequency tagging, we chose an invisible patch to avoid any confounds by response enhancement, e.g. by object-based attention or figure-ground segregation \citep{self2016effects}.} 

 \paragraph{Task \& Time Course}
Participants were kept vigilant by performing a simple visual detection task that required them to respond to a 45$^{\circ}$ rotation of the fixation cross at the center of the screen, which occurred once every minute \citep[e.g.][]{zaehle2010transcranial}. Data including the target and/or the responses were discarded and not considered in the analysis. The rotation took place after a trial in the majority, i.e. 60\%, of the cases. The remaining 40\% of rotations took place at any point during a trial. The experiment was divided into 15 blocks of 4.5 min, resulting in a recording time of 75 min in total. \textcolor{red}{The 40 frequency$\times$condition combinations were presented once in each block, in randomized order, resulting in a total of 15 trials per flicker frequency and condition.} To minimize the amount of trials rejected by eye-blink artifacts, 3 s breaks, indicated by a motivating catchphrase or happy face on the screen, were incorporated every five trials, i.e. every 25 - 35 seconds. Participants were instructed to utilize these breaks to rest their eyes.

\subsection{Participants} \noindent
This project was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee at University of Birmingham, UK.
Thirty-one students of the University of Birmingham participated in the experiment. One experimental session was terminated prematurely due to the participant not being cooperative, resulting in a sample of thirty participants (15 female), aged 25.7 $\pm$ 3.4 years. This sample size was decided upon based on a conceptually similar study investigating entrainment of neuronal alpha oscillations by \citet{notbohm2016modification}. All volunteers declared not to have had a history of neuropsychiatric or psychological disorder, reported to be medication-free and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. For safety reasons, participants with metal items inside their bodies were excluded at the selection state. Prior to  taking part in the study, participants gave informed consent, in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, to both the MEG recording and the MRI scan and were explicitly apprised of their right to abort the experiment at any point. The reimbursement amounted to \textsterling15 per hour.
To allow analysis of flicker responses at frequencies with a sufficient distance to the individual gamma frequency (IGF; see \ref{IGF}) of the participant, i.e. $\pm$6 Hz, 8 participants were excluded due to their IGF being below 58 Hz. Thus, the data of 22 participants were included in the following analyses (11 female; mean age 25.7 years).

\subsection{MEG Data Analysis}\noindent

Analyses were performed in MATLAB 2017a and 2019b (The MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA, USA) using the fieldtrip toolbox \citep{oostenveld2011fieldtrip}.

\subsubsection{Sensor Analysis}
At the sensor level, the analysis was confined to the planar gradiometer signals, as these provided the best signal-to-noise ratio. 
\paragraph{MEG preprocessing} Trials containing the target or button presses were excluded. The data were read into MATLAB as 5 s and 7 s trials for the \RFTonly and \gammaRFT conditions, respectively. Artefactual sensors were identified visually during and after the recordings for each participant, and interpolated with the data of their neighboring sensors (0 to 2 sensors per participant). The individual trials were linearly detrended. Trials containing head movements and/or multiple eye blinks were discarded using a semi-automatic approach. An ICA approach ('runica' implemented in FieldTrip) was used to project out cardiac signals, eye blinks and eye movement. The sensor positions relative to the HPI coils were loaded in from the data files and averaged for each subject. 
\paragraph{Time-Frequency Representation of Power}
Time-Frequency Representations (TFRs) of power were calculated using a sliding time-window approach ($\Delta$T = 0.5 s; 0.05 s steps). A Hanning taper (0.5 s) was applied prior to the Fourier-transform. This approach induced spectral smoothing of $\pm$3 Hz.  Relative power change in response to the stimulation, i.e. the moving grating and/or the photic drive, was calculated as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rlc}
P\textsubscript{normalized} = \frac{P\textsubscript{stim}}{P\textsubscript{base}} - 1   
\end{equation}

with $P\textsubscript{stim}$ being the power during stimulation and $P\textsubscript{base}$ being the power in the baseline interval. The baseline interval was 0.75 - 0.25 s prior to the onset of the flicker (\RFTonly condition) or the moving grating stimulus (\gammaRFT condition).

\paragraph{Individual Gamma Frequency}
The frequency band of the oscillatory activity elicited in response to the moving grating stimulus was identified individually per participant. TFRs of power were calculated for the baseline interval and presentation of the moving grating in the \gammaRFT condition and averaged over trials. The results were averaged over the 0.25 - 1.75 s interval, and the frequency bin with the maximum relative power was considered the Individual Gamma Frequency (IGF). For each participant, the 4 to 6 gradiometers with the strongest gamma response to the moving gratings were selected as the Sensors-of-Interest (SOI).
 
\paragraph{Phase-Locking}
The average phase-synchrony between the photodiode (recording the visual flicker) and the neuromagnetic signal at the SOI was quantified by the Phase-Locking Value (PLV) \citep[][]{lachaux1999measuring,bastos2016tutorial} calculated using a 0.5 s sliding window multiplied with a Hanning taper of equal length. The phases of both signals were calculated from Fourier transformations,  applied to the tapered segments. The PLV was computed separately for each \textit{frequency$\times$condition} combination:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:plv}  PLV = \frac{1}{n}\lvert \sum_{n=1}^{N}exp(j\theta(t,n))\rvert\end{equation}
where $\theta(t,n) = \phi\textsubscript{m}(t,n) - \phi\textsubscript{p}(t,n)$ is the phase difference between the MEG (m) and the photodiode (p) signal at time bin $t$ in trial $n$ \citep[see][p.195 and Figure \ref{fig:freq_fun} and \ref{fig:plat_singlesubj}]{lachaux1999measuring}.  
\paragraph{Phase difference as a measure of entrainment}
Additionally, we investigated changes in phase difference between the photodiode and neuromagnetic signal over time for flicker frequencies of IGF$\pm$6 Hz, to identify intervals of strong synchrony, so-called \textit{phase plateaus}. MEG and photodiode signals ($\Delta$T = 3 cycles = $\frac{3}{f_{flicker}}3/$s) were convolved with a complex Hanning taper using the sliding time window approach. Phase angles were derived from the Fourier transformed time series, unwrapped and subtracted to estimate the phase difference over time for each trial. Plateaus were defined as a constant phase angle (maximum average gradient \< 0.01 rad/ms) over the duration of one cycle of the stimulation frequency:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:plat}   \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\Delta T}\lvert \nabla\theta_{i}\rvert}{n} \leqslant 0.01 rad/ms\end{equation}

with $\nabla\theta_{i}$ being the gradient, i.e. slope, of the phase angle between MEG and photodiode signal at a given sample $i$; $n$ being the length of the cycle in ms, rounded up to the next integer, e.g. 17 ms for a flicker frequency of 60 Hz. \textcolor{red}{This approach allowed to identify intermittent phase plateaus in each trial. The PLV analysis described above quantifies the phase-similarity of the two signals over trials, and is therefore not feasible to capture brief episodes of synchrony between the MEG signal and the stimulation.}

\paragraph{Statistical Analysis} Statistical Analysis was performed in RStudio Version 1.2.1355 (RStudio Inc., Northern Ave, Boston, MA; R version 3.6.1., The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

\subsubsection{Source Analysis} \noindent
\paragraph{MRI preprocessing} The raw T1 weighted images were converted from DICOM to NIFTI. The coordinate system of the participants' individual MRI was aligned to the anatomical landmarks using the head-surface obtained from the MRI and the scalp shapes digitized prior to the recordings. Realignment was done automatically using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm \citep{besl1992method} implemented in the FieldTrip toolbox and corrected manually as necessary. The digitized headshape of one participant, for whom there was no anatomical image available, was aligned to a standardized template brain.
 
\paragraph{Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance Beamforming} The neuroanatomical origins of the visually induced gamma oscillations and the response induced by the photic drive condition were estimated using Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance spatial filters \citep[LCMV;][]{van1997localization}, implemented in the Fieldtrip Toolbox \citep{oostenveld2011fieldtrip}. The MEG forward model was calculated using single-shell head-models, estimated based on the aligned anatomical images, and an equally spaced 4-mm grid, warped into MNI (Montreal Neurologic Institute) space  \citep[\citealt{nolte2003magnetic}, also see][]{oostenveld2011fieldtrip,stenroos2014comparison}; yielding 37,163 dipoles inside the brain. The pre-processed data, epoched in 7 and 5-second trials for the respective conditions, were band-pass filtered at 50 to 92 Hz, by applying second order Butterworth two-pass high- and low-pass filters. \textcolor{red}{To identify the peak locations of the endogenous gamma oscillations and flicker response, respectively, segments of 0.5 s of the baseline interval (0.75 - 0.25 s prior to stimulation) and the stimulation interval (0.75 - 1.25 s after flicker/grating onset) were extracted from the data in both conditions. The peak source of the flicker response to the flickering gratings was isolated based on the 2.75 to 3.25 interval, when the photic drive was superimposed on the gratings, contrasted with the 0.75 to 1.25 interval during which the gratings were presented.}. For each participant, a common covariance matrix for the 204 planar gradiometers was computed based on the extracted time series and used to estimate the spatial filter coefficients for each dipole location, whereby only the direction with the highest dipole moment was considered. Data in the baseline and stimulation intervals were projected to source space by multiplying each filter coefficient with the sensor time series. Fast Fourier Transforms of the resulting time series, multiplied with a Hanning taper, were computed for each of the 37,163 virtual channels, separately for the baseline and stimulation intervals, and averaged over trials. Relative power change at the IGF and flicker frequencies was computed by applying equation \eqref{eq:rlc} to the Fourier-transformed baseline and stimulation intervals. The source-localized power change values at flicker frequencies up to 78 Hz were averaged to identify a common source for the oscillatory response to the photic drive.
\textcolor{red}{\subsection{Experimental Design \& Statistical Analyses}
Using the experimental set up outlined above, this study aimed to explore resonance properties of the visual cortex, reflecting oscillatory dynamics in each participant. Furthermore, we asked if responses to a visual flicker close to and at the IGF are enhanced when the flicker is superimposed on the moving grating stimuli. This would reflect a change in the oscillatory dynamics in presence of the endogenous gamma oscillations. In this context, we hypothesized that these oscillations would synchronize to the flicker. The 40 frequency$\times$condition combinations were tested in all participants, i.e. in a within-subject design. Resonance at individually preferred rhythms would be revealed by a high response magnitude to stimulation frequencies in comparison to the surrounding frequencies \citep{herrmann2001human,schwab2006alpha,notbohm2016modification} (H\textsubscript{1}). A general decrease in response to the flicker as a function of frequency would suggest an absence of such an amplification (H\textsubscript{0}). Entrainment of the ongoing gamma rhythm by the flicker response would result in the peak frequency of the gamma oscillator being synchronized to the stimulation frequency. This is reflected by a reduction in power at the IGF during the application of the flicker to the gratings, at frequencies different from the IGF, compared to the presentation of he gratings alone (H\textsubscript{1}).
Statistical analyses were performed in R \citep[][version 3.6.3., using RStudio version 1.2.5033, RStudio Inc., Boston, Massachusetts]{R}. The statistical power of the individual tests was evaluated using Bayes Factors, computed using the BayesFactor package in R \citep{BayesFactor}. As the identified IGF was found to be higher than the frequency inducing the strongest flicker response in the majority of participants, we quantified their relationship using a simple Binomial test with an a priori defined alpha level of 0.01. The linearity of the flicker response power as a function of flicker frequency, i.e. evidence for the H\textsubscript{0} as observed in the results reported below, was corroborated using linear regression models implemented in the R base package.
Changes in the power at the IGF, with the onset of the flicker in the \gammaRFT condition, were examined using a repeated measures ANOVA on the factors time (pre and during flicker) and flicker frequency (above and below IGF), as implemented in package ez in R \citep{ez}. Lastly, we compared the peak sources of the gamma oscillations and flicker responses, identified using LCMV beamforming, in both conditions using dependent sample t-tests. As the direction of the distances was not known a priori, the alpha level was set to 0.025. To reduce the dimensionality of the comparisons, the obtained 3D coordinates were first projected along their first Principal Component \citep{herrmann2011syntactic}. The p-values of the three comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.}
