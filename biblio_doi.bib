To examine a possible causal contribution of gamma oscillations to cognitive function, recent studies have employed various types of brain stimulation to induce gamma oscillations. Techniques such as optogenetics or sensory stimulation appear to engage canonical neurocircuits that encompass excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, similarly to those driven by sensory experience, to induce gamma entrainment. Sensory evoked gamma entrainment improves cognitive function in mouse models. Oscillations have traditionally been studied at the neurophysiological level; however, sensory evoked gamma entrainment is able to induce gene expression changes in multiple cell types including neurons and microglia. Furthermore, evidence suggests that chronic gamma entrainment offers neuroprotective effects.},

abstract = {Using magnetoencephalography, we studied the spatiotemporal properties of cortical responses in terms of event-related synchronization and event-related desynchronization to a range of stripe patterns in subjects with no neurological disorders. These stripes are known for their tendency to induce a range of abnormal sensations, such as illusions, nausea, dizziness, headache and attacks of pattern-sensitive epilepsy. The optimal stimulus must have specific physical properties, and maximum abnormalities occur at specific spatial frequency and contrast. Despite individual differences in the severity of discomfort experienced, psychophysical studies have shown that most observers experience some degree of visual anomaly on viewing such patterns. In a separate experiment, subjects reported the incidence of illusions and discomfort to each pattern. We found maximal cortical power in the gamma range (30-60 Hz) confined to the region of the primary visual cortex in response to patterns of 2-4 cycles per degree, peaking at 3 cycles per degree. This coincides with the peak of mean illusions and discomfort, also maximal for patterns of 2-4 cycles per degree. We show that gamma band activity in V1 is a narrow band function of spatial frequency. We hypothesize that the intrinsic properties of gamma oscillations may underlie visual discomfort and play a role in the onset of seizures.},

Recent measurements of gamma-band activity at the cellular level stress high level functional correlates such as binding of features. In contrast, field potential measurements in both humans and animals demonstrate that gamma-band responses may have multifold functions both in 'obligatory' sensory and in cognitive processing.

First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems. We discuss how these issues can be addressed using current methods.},

The original CTC statement proposed that uni-directional communication is due to rhythmic entrainment with an inter-areal delay and a resulting non-zero phase relation, whereas bi-directional communication is due to zero-phase synchronization. Recent studies found that inter-areal gamma-band synchronization entails a non-zero phase lag. We therefore modify the CTC hypothesis and propose that bi-directional cortical communication is realized separately for the two directions by uni-directional CTC mechanisms entailing delays in both directions. We review evidence suggesting that inter-areal influences in the feedforward and feedback directions are segregated both anatomically and spectrally.},

This effect is specific to the middle of the gamma range because it is not evident at {\textless}35-Hz flicker. It requires 300 ms to build up, dissipates within 250 ms of flicker offset, and shows a tendency to invert after 500 ms.

abstract = {Oscillatory synchronization of neuronal populations has been proposed to play a role in perceptual integration and attentional processing. However, some conflicting evidence has been found with respect to its causal relevance for sensory processing, particularly when using flickering visual stimuli with the aim of driving oscillations. We tested psychophysically whether the relative phase of gamma frequency flicker (60 Hz) between stimuli modulates well-known facilitatory lateral interactions between collinear Gabor patches (Experiment 1) or crowding of a peripheral target by irrelevant distractors (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 assessed the impact of suprathreshold Gabor flankers on detection of a near-threshold central Gabor target ("Lateral interactions paradigm"). The flanking stimuli could flicker either in phase or in anti-phase with each other. The typical facilitation of target detection was found with collinear flankers, but this was unaffected by flicker phase. Experiment 2 employed a "crowding" paradigm, where orientation discrimination of a peripheral target Gabor patch is disrupted when surrounded by irrelevant distractors. We found the usual crowding effect, which declined with spatial separation, but this was unaffected by relative flicker phase between target and distractors at all separations. These results imply that externally driven manipulations of gamma frequency phase cannot modulate perceptual integration in vision. {\textcopyright} ARVO.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of “shape complexity,” one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given “model” shape and a sensed “data” shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

abstract = {Non-extrastriate projections to area V1 in monkeys, now demonstrated by several anatomical studies, are potential substrates of physiologically documented multisensory effects in primary sensory areas. The full network of projections among association and primary areas, however, is likely to be complex and is still only partially understood. In the present report, we used the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine to investigate projections to areas V1 and V2 from subdivisions of the parietal association cortex in macaque. Parietal cortex was chosen to allow comparisons between projections from this higher association area and from other previously reported areas. In addition, we were interested in further elucidating pathways to areas V1 and V2 from parietal areas, as potentially contributing to attention and active vision. Of eight cases, three brains had projections only to area V2, and the five others projected to both areas V1 and V2. Terminations in area V1 were sparse. These were located in supragranular layers I, II, upper III; occasionally in IVB; and in layer VI. Terminations in V2 were denser, and slightly more prevalent in the supragranular layers. For both areas, terminations were in the calcarine region, corresponding to the representation of the peripheral visual field. By reconstructions of single axons, we demonstrated that four of nine axons had collaterals, either to V1 and V2 (n = 1) or to area V1 and a ventral area likely to be TEO (n = 3). In area V1, axons extended divergently in layer VI as well as layer I. Overall, these and previous results suggest a nested connectivity architecture, consisting of multiple direct and indirect recurrent projections from association areas to area V1. Terminations in area V1 are not abundant, but could be potentiated by the network of indirect connections. {\textcopyright} 2011 Borra and Rockland.},

Yet, convergence typically sends multiple stimuli to a target, and the behaviorally relevant stimulus must be selected. We used two stimuli, activating separate electrocorticographic V1 sites, and both activating an electrocorticographic V4 site equally strongly. When one of those stimuli activated one V1 site, it gamma synchronized (60-80 Hz) to V4. When the two stimuli activated two V1 sites, primarily the relevant one gamma synchronized to V4. Frequency bands of gamma activities showed substantial overlap containing the band of interareal coherence. The relevant V1 site had its gamma peak frequency 2-3 Hz higher than the irrelevant V1 site and 4-6 Hz higher than V4. Gamma-mediated interareal influences were predominantly directed from V1 to V4. We propose that selective synchronization renders relevant input effective, thereby modulating effective connectivity.},

abstract = {With a multielectrode system, we explored neuronal activity in the $\gamma$ range ({\textgreater}40 Hz) in the primary and caudomedial auditory cortex of six anesthetized macaque monkeys. Stimuli were tone bursts of 100- to 500-ms duration that were presented at sound pressure levels of 40-60 dB and were varied over a wide range of frequencies. These stimuli induced $\gamma$ oscillations, not phase-locked to the onset of stimulation, in 465 of 616 multiunit clusters and at 321 of 422 sites at which field potentials were recorded. Occurrence of $\gamma$ activity was stimulus dependent. It was mostly seen when the stimulus was at the units' preferred frequency. The incidence of $\gamma$ activity decreased with increasing difference between stimulus frequency and preferred frequency. $\gamma$ activity emerged 100-900 ms after stimulus onset with highest incidence ∼120 ms. Amplitudes of stimulus-induced $\gamma$ oscillations in field potentials were, on average, almost twice the amplitude of spontaneously occurring $\gamma$ oscillations. $\gamma$ activity at different sites within the primary and the caudomedial auditory field could be synchronized at near-zero phase. Synchrony depended on the spatial distance and on the receptive fields similarity of pairs of units. It decreased with increasing distance between recording sites and increased with similarity of preferred frequencies of the pairs of units. The results indicate that stimulus-induced $\gamma$ oscillations originate from sources in the auditory cortex. They further suggest that $\gamma$ oscillations may provide a mechanism utilized in many parts of the sensory cortex, including the auditory cortex, to integrate neurons according to the similarity of their receptive fields.},

In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40-60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers,whereas the deep layers showedmaximal coherence at low frequencies (6-16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers. The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.},

abstract = {Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain amatter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the "operational modes" of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Annual Reviews.

@article{carandini1997linearity,
abstract = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex often appear to compute a weighted sum of the light intensity distribution of the visual stimuli that fall on their receptive fields. A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fall to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the lineal responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well.},

Recent experimental evidence suggests that projections descending the hierarchy and targeting the primary visual cortex (area V1) may play an essential role in perceptual processes. We have, therefore, reexamined feedback projections to area V1, using retrograde tracer injections in this area. In addition to well-known areas, quantification of labeling in higher cortical areas reveals a number of hitherto unknown long-distance feedback connections originating from auditory (A1), multisensory (STP) cortices, but also from a perirhinal area (36). These feedback projections from advanced cortical stations, a global feature shared by areas that belong to the ventral visual stream, could play an important role in early multisensory integration and spatial awareness and could provide the physical substrate for the involvement of area V1 in visual consciousness.},

@article{cole2019cycle,
abstract = {Neural oscillations are widely studied using methods based on the Fourier transform, which models data as sums of sinusoids. This has successfully uncovered numerous links between oscillations and cognition or disease. However, neural data are nonsinusoidal, and these nonsinusoidal features are increasingly linked to a variety of behavioral and cognitive states, pathophysiology, and underlying neuronal circuit properties. We present a new analysis framework, one that is complementary to existing Fourier and Hilbert transform-based approaches, that quantifies oscillatory features in the time domain on a cycle-by-cycle basis. We have released this cycle-by-cycle analysis suite as "bycycle," a fully documented, open-source Python package with detailed tutorials and troubleshooting cases. This approach performs tests to assess whether an oscillation is present at any given moment and, if so, quantifies each oscillatory cycle by its amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry, the latter of which is missed with the use of conventional approaches. In a series of simulated event-related studies, we show how conventional Fourier and Hilbert transform approaches can conflate event-related changes in oscillation burst duration as increased oscillatory amplitude and as a change in the oscillation frequency, even though those features were unchanged in simulation. Our approach avoids these errors. Furthermore, we validate this approach in simulation and against experimental recordings of patients with Parkinson's disease, who are known to have nonsinusoidal beta (12-30 Hz) oscillations.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY We introduce a fully documented, open-source Python package, bycycle, for analyzing neural oscillations on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This approach is complementary to traditional Fourier and Hilbert transform-based approaches but avoids specific pitfalls. First, bycycle confirms an oscillation is present, to avoid analyzing aperiodic, nonoscillatory data as oscillations. Next, it quantifies nonsinusoidal aspects of oscillations, increasingly linked to neural circuit physiology, behavioral states, and diseases. This approach is tested against simulated and real data.},

@article{colgin2009frequency,
abstract = {Gamma oscillations are thought to transiently link distributed cell assemblies that are processing related information, a function that is probably important for network processes such as perception, attentional selection and memory. This binding mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from 25 to almost 150Hz. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animals current position, and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information. Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Various propositions exist, likening the thalamus to a gate, or a high pass filter. Here, using a simple leaky integrate and fire model based on physiological parameters, we show that the thalamus behaves akin to a low pass filter. Specifically, as individual cells in the thalamus rely on consistent drive to spike, stimuli that is rapidly and continuously changing over time such that it activates sensory cells with different receptive fields are unable to drive thalamic spiking. This means that thalamic encoding is robust to sensory noise, however it induces a lag in sensory representation. Thus, the thalamus stabilizes encoding of sensory information, at the cost of response rate.},

While sampling by the retina is a complex spatio-temporal neural event, it is often useful to consider it to be a passive event governed only by the geometry of the receptor grid and the stationary probability of a single receptor absorbing a photon. In the human retina, there are two parallel sampling grids to consider, one comprising the rod photoreceptors and operating in dim light, and the other comprising the cone photoreceptors and operating in moderate to bright light. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Hornbills fed on fruits of 49 plant species that comprised over 95 percent of their diet. Hornbill species partitioned food resources by varying the relative contribution of figs and non-fig fruits in the diet. Similarity in non-fig fruit diet was low. Ten species contributed to over 90 percent of the non-fig diet. The availability of non-fig fruits was much lower in the nonbreeding season than in the breeding season; however, despite lower fruit availability during the nonbreeding season, hornbills had a wide diet breadth and indirect evidence suggests that Wreathed Hornbills foraged widely in this season for fruit. Great Hornbills relied more on figs that were available year-round.

abstract = {Auditory cortical activity is entrained to the temporal envelope of speech, which corresponds to the syllabic rhythm of speech. Such entrained cortical activity can be measured from subjects naturally listening to sentences or spoken passages, providing a reliable neural marker of online speech processing. A central question still remains to be answered about whether cortical entrained activity is more closely related to speech perception or non-speech-specific auditory encoding. Here, we review a few hypotheses about the functional roles of cortical entrainment to speech, e.g., encoding acoustic features, parsing syllabic boundaries, and selecting sensory information in complex listening environments. It is likely that speech entrainment is not a homogeneous response and these hypotheses apply separately for speech entrainment generated from different neural sources. The relationship between entrained activity and speech intelligibility is also discussed. A tentative conclusion is that theta-band entrainment (4-8 Hz) encodes speech features critical for intelligibility while delta-band entrainment (1-4 Hz) is related to the perceived, non-speech-specific acoustic rhythm. To further understand the functional properties of speech entrainment, a splitter's approach will be needed to investigate (1) not just the temporal envelope but what specific acoustic features are encoded and (2) not just speech intelligibility but what specific psycholinguistic processes are encoded by entrained cortical activity. Similarly, the anatomical and spectro-temporal details of entrained activity need to be taken into account when investigating its functional properties. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ding and Simon.},

Here, we investigate the relationship between alpha fluctuations and spiking responses to visual stimuli across cortical layers. Using laminar probes in macaque V1, we show that neural firing couples with the phase of alpha fluctuations, and that magnitude of this coupling is particularly pronounced during visual stimulation. The strongest modulation of spiking activity was observed in layers 2/3. Alpha-spike coupling and current source density analysis pointed to an infragranular origin of the alpha fluctuations. Taken together, these results indicate that ongoing infragranular alpha-range fluctuations in V1 play a role in regulating columnar visual activity.},

However, there is no consensus on the spatial extent of the cortex that contributes to the LFP (its “spatial spread”), with different studies reporting values between a few hundred micrometers and several millimeters. Furthermore, the dependency of the spatial spread on frequency, which could reflect properties of the network architecture and extracellular medium, is not well studied, with theory and models predicting either “all-pass” (frequency-independent) or “low-pass” behavior. Surprisingly, we found the LFP spread to be “band-pass” in the primate primary visual cortex, with the greatest spread in the high-gamma range (60–150 Hz). This was accompanied by an increase in phase coherency across neighboring sites in the same frequency range, consistent with the findings of a recent model that reconciles previous studies by suggesting that spatial spread depends on neuronal correlations.},

abstract = {Primary visual coding can be characterized by the receptive field (RF) properties of single neurons. Subject of this paper is our search for a global, second coding step beyond the RF-concept that links related features in a visual scene. In recent models of visual coding, oscillatory activities have been proposed to constitute such linking signals. We tested the neurophysiological relevance of this hypothesis for the visual system. Single and multiple spikes as well as local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from several locations in the primary visual cortex (A17 and A18) using 7 or 19 individually advanceable fibermicroelectrodes (250 or 330 $\mu$m apart). Stimulusevoked (SE)-resonances of 35-85 Hz were found in these three types of signals throughout the visual cortex when the primary coding channels were activated by their specific stimuli. Stimulus position, orientation, movement direction and velocity, ocularity and stationary flicker caused specific SE-resonances. Coherent SE-resonances were found at distant cortical positions when at least one of the primary coding properties was similar. Coherence was found 1) within a vertical cortex column, 2) between neighbouring hypercolumns, and 3) between two different cortical areas. We assume that the coherence of SE-resonances is mediated by recurrent excitatory intra- and inter-areal connections via phase locking between assemblies that represent the linking features of the actual visual scene. Visually related activities are, thus, transiently labelled by a temporal code that signalizes their momentary association. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process.

We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process.

abstract = {Previously, we have demonstrated that a subpopulation of visual cortical neurons exhibit oscillatory responses to their preferred stimuli at a frequency near 50 Hz (Gray {\&} Singer, 1989). These responses can selectively synchronize over large distances of cortex in a stimulus-specific manner (Gray et al., 1989; Engel et al., 1990a). Here we report the results of a new analysis which reveals the fine temporal structure inherent in these interactions. We utilized pairs of recordings of the local field potential (LFP) activity from area 17 in the anesthetized cat which met two criteria. The LFP was correlated with the underlying unit activity at each site and the recording sites were at least 5 mm apart in cortex. A moving-window technique was applied to compute cross correlograms on 100-ms epochs of data repeated at intervals of 30 ms for a period of 3s during each direction of stimulus movement. A statistical test was devised to determine the significance of detected correlations. In this way we were able to determine the magnitude, phase difference, frequency, and duration of correlated oscillations as a function of time. The results demonstrate that (1) the duration of synchrony is variable and lasts from 100–900 ms; (2) the phase differences between and the frequencies of synchronized responses are also variable within and between events and range from +3 to-3 ms and 40–60 Hz, respectively; and (3) multiple correlation events often occur within a single stimulus period. These results demonstrate a high degree of dynamic variability and a rapid onset and offset of synchrony among interacting populations of neurons which is consistent with the requirements of a mechanism for feature integration. {\textcopyright} 1992, Cambridge University Press.

To enhance our understanding of brain rhythms and improve clinical outcomes in pathological conditions, modulation of neural activity by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) emerged as a promising approach.

Objective: Here, we investigated the phase-specificity of tACS on visually evoked steady state responses (SSRs) in 24 healthy human participants. Methods: We used an intermittent electrical stimulation protocol and assessed the influence of tACS on SSR amplitude in the interval immediately following tACS. A neural network model served to validate the plausibility of experimental findings. Results: We observed a modulation of SSR amplitudes dependent on the phase shift between flicker and tACS. The tACS effect size was negatively correlated with the strength of flicker-evoked activity. Supported by simulations, data suggest that strong network synchronization limits further neuromodulation by tACS. Neural sources of phase-specific effects were localized in the parieto-occipital cortex within flicker-entrained regions. Importantly, the optimal phase shift between flicker and tACS associated with strongest SSRs was correlated with SSR phase delays in the tACS target region. Conclusions: Overall, our data provide electrophysiological evidence for phase-specific modulations of rhythmic brain activity by tACS in humans. As the optimal timing of tACS application was dependent on cortical SSR phase delays, our data suggest that tACS effects were not mediated by retinal co-stimulation. These findings highlight the potential of tACS for controlled, phase-specific modulations of neural activity.},

ECoG were recorded from up to 64 electrodes 0.5 mm apart in a linear array 3.2 cm long, which was placed on the exposed superior temporal gyrus or motor cortex of volunteers undergoing diagnostic surgery. Visual displays of multiple traces revealed broad spectrum oscillations in episodic bursts having a common aperiodic wave form with recurring patterns of spatial amplitude modulation (AM patterns) on selected portions of the array. The one-dimensional spatial spectrum of the human ECoG was calculated at successive time samples and averaged over periods of up to 20 s. Log power decreased monotonically with increasing log spatial frequency in cycles/mm (c/mm) to the noise level {\~{}} 2 log units below maximal power at minimal frequency (0.039 ± 0.002 c/mm). The inflection point at 0.40 ± 0.05 c/mm specified an optimal value for a low pass spatial filter to remove noise, and an optimal interelectrode spacing of 1.25 mm to avoid undersampling and aliasing. An 8 x 8 array with that spacing would be 10 x 10 mm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, it appears as if many different gamma-band synchronization phenomena subserve many different functions. I argue that gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process that subserves an elemental operation of cortical computation. Cortical computation unfolds in the interplay between neuronal dynamics and structural neuronal connectivity. A core motif of neuronal connectivity is convergence, which brings about both selectivity and invariance of neuronal responses. However, those core functions can be achieved simultaneously only if converging neuronal inputs are functionally segmented and if only one segment is selected at a time. This segmentation and selection can be elegantly achieved if structural connectivity interacts with neuronal synchronization. I propose that this process is at least one of the fundamental functions of gamma-band synchronization, which then subserves numerous higher cognitive functions.

abstract = {Activated neuronal groups typically engage in rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). Experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that each gamma cycle is framed by synchronized spiking of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with excitatory input to pyramidal cells such that the more excited cells fire earlier in the gamma cycle. Thus, the amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded into phase values of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This recoding enables transmission and read out of amplitude information within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate integration. Furthermore, variation of phase relations can be exploited to facilitate or inhibit exchange of information between oscillating cell assemblies. The gamma cycle could thus serve as a fundamental computational mechanism for the implementation of a temporal coding scheme that enables fast processing and flexible routing of activity, supporting fast selection and binding of distributed responses.

What has been lacking is an introductory textbook that brings together the different fields and provides a gentle introduction to the major concepts and findings in the emerging field of network neuroscience. Network Neuroscience is a one-stop-shop that is of equal use to the neurobiologist, who is interested in understanding the quantitative methods employed in network neuroscience, and to the physicist or engineer, who is interested in neuroscience applications of mathematical and engineering tools. The book spans 27 chapters that cover everything from individual cells all the way to complex network disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorders. An additional 12 toolboxes provide the necessary background for making network neuroscience accessible independent of the reader's background. Dr. Flavio Frohlich (www.networkneuroscientist.org) wrote this book based on his experience of mentoring dozens of trainees in the Frohlich Lab, from undergraduate students to senior researchers. The Frohlich lab (www.frohlichlab.org) pursues a unique and integrated vision that combines computer simulations, animal model studies, human studies, and clinical trials with the goal of developing novel brain stimulation treatments for psychiatric disorders. The book is based on a course he teaches at UNC that has attracted trainees from many different departments, including neuroscience, biomedical engineering, psychology, cell biology, physiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Dr. Frohlich has consistently received rave reviews for his teaching. With this book he hopes to make his integrated view of neuroscience available to trainees and researchers on a global scale. His goal is to make the book the training manual for the next generation of (network) neuroscientists, who will be fusing biology, engineering, and medicine to unravel the big questions about the brain and to revolutionize psychiatry and neurology.

The neuronal firing pattern is tightly correlated with the phase and amplitude of an oscillatory local field potential recorded through the same electrode. The amplitude of the local field-potential oscillations are maximal in response to stimuli that match the orientation and direction preference of the local cluster of neurons. Single and multiunit recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus showed no evidence of oscillations of the neuronal firing probability in the range of 20-70 Hz. The results demonstrate that local neuronal populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an intracortical mechanism.

Does attention modulate SSVEP amplitude at higher flicker frequencies (gamma band, 30–80 Hz), and is attentional modulation constant across frequencies? By isolating SSVEP responses from the broadband EEG signal using a multivariate spatiotemporal source separation method, we demonstrate that flicker in the alpha and gamma bands elicit strongest and maximally phase stable brain responses (resonance), on which the effect of attention is opposite: positive for gamma and negative for alpha. Finding subject-specific gamma resonance frequency and a positive attentional modulation of gamma-band SSVEPs points to the untapped potential of flicker as a non-invasive tool for studying the causal effects of interactions between visual gamma-band rhythmic stimuli and endogenous gamma oscillations on perception and attention.},

@article{haegens2015laminar,
abstract = {The functional significance of the $\alpha$ rhythm is widely debated. It has been proposed that $\alpha$ reflects sensory inhibition and/or a temporal sampling or “parsing” mechanism. There is also continuing disagreement over the more fundamental questions of which cortical layers generate $\alpha$ rhythms and whether the generation of $\alpha$ is equivalent across sensory systems. To address these latter questions, we analyzed laminar profiles of local field potentials (LFPs) and concomitant multiunit activity (MUA) from macaque V1, S1, and A1 during both spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Current source density (CSD) analysis of laminar LFP profiles revealed $\alpha$ current generators in the supragranular, granular, and infragranular layers.MUAphase-locked to local current source/sink configurations confirmed that $\alpha$ rhythms index local neuronal excitability fluctuations. CSD-defined $\alpha$ generators were strongest in the supragranular layers, whereas LFP $\alpha$ power was greatest in the infragranular layers, consistent with some of the previous reports. The discrepancy between LFP and CSD findings appears to be attributable to contamination of the infragranular LFP signal by activity that is volume-conducted from the stronger supragranular $\alpha$ generators. The presence of $\alpha$ generators across cortical depth in V1, S1, and A1 suggests the involvement of $\alpha$ in feedforward as well as feedback processes and is consistent with the view that $\alpha$ rhythms, perhaps in addition to a role in sensory inhibition, may parse sensory input streams in a way that facilitates communication across cortical areas.},

This has been demonstrated by a plethora of studies relating memory processes to specific oscillatory signatures. Several recent studies have gone beyond such correlative approaches and provided evidence supporting the idea that modulating oscillations via frequency-specific entrainment can alter memory functions. Such causal evidence is important because it allows distinguishing mechanisms directly related to memory from mere epiphenomenal oscillatory signatures of memory. This review provides an overview of stimulation studies using different approaches to entrain brain oscillations for modulating human memory. We argue that these studies demonstrate a causal link between brain oscillations and memory, speaking against an epiphenomenal perspective of brain oscillations.},

Specifically, desynchronization of local neuronal assemblies in the left inferior prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the beta frequency (∼18 Hz) has been shown to be central for encoding of verbal memories [5-8]. However, it remains elusive whether prefrontal beta desynchronization is causally relevant for memory formation and whether these endogenous beta oscillations can be entrained by external stimulation. By using combined EEG-TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), we here address these fundamental questions in human participants performing a word-list learning task. Confirming our predictions, memory encoding was selectively impaired when the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was driven at beta (18.7 Hz) compared to stimulation at other frequencies (6.8 Hz and 10.7 Hz) and to ineffective sham stimulation (18.7 Hz). Furthermore, a sustained oscillatory "echo" in the left IFG, which outlasted the stimulation period by approximately 1.5 s, was observed solely after beta stimulation. The strength of this beta echo was related to memory impairment on a between-subjects level. These results show endogenous oscillatory entrainment effects and behavioral impairment selectively in beta frequency for stimulation of the left IFG, demonstrating an intimate causal relationship between prefrontal beta desynchronization and memory formation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This sequence spans up to {\~{}} 15 ms and is referenced not to external events but to the internal cortical activity (e.g., beta/gamma oscillations). Most importantly, the preferred sequence of firing changed consistently as a function of stimulus properties.

This suggests that, in the visual system, short-lived spatio-temporal patterns of spiking defined by consistent delays in synchronized activity occur with sufficient reliability to complement firing rates as a neuronal code. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

abstract = {We investigated the dynamics of neurons in the striate cortex (V1) and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to study the transformation in temporal-frequency tuning between the LGN and V1. Furthermore, we compared the temporal-frequency tuning of simple with that of complex cells and direction-selective cells with nondirection-selective cells, in order to determine whether there are significant differences in temporal-frequency tuning among distinct functional classes of cells within V1. In addition, we compared the cells in the primary input layers of V1 (4a, 4c$\alpha$, and 4c$\beta$) with cells in the layers that are predominantly second and higher order (2, 3, 4b, 5, and 6). We measured temporal-frequency responses to drifting sinusoidal gratings. For LGN neurons and simple cells, we used the amplitude and phase of the fundamental response. For complex cells, the elevation of impulse rate (F0) to a drifting grating was the response measure. There is significant low-pass filtering between the LGN and the input layers of V1 accompanied by a small, 3-ms increase in visual delay. There is further low-pass filtering between V1 input layers and the second- and higher-order neurons in V1. This results in an average decrease in high cutoff temporal-frequency between the LGN and V1 output layers of about 20 Hz and an increase in average visual latency of about 12-14 ms. One of the most salient results is the increased diversity of the dynamic properties seen in V1 when compared to the cells of the lateral geniculate, possibly reflecting specialization of function among cells in V1. Simple and complex cells had distributions of temporal-frequency tuning properties that were similar to each other. Direction-selective and nondirection-selective cells had similar preferred and high cutoff temporal frequencies, but direction-selective cells were almost exclusively band-pass while nondirection-selective cells distributed equally between band-pass and low-pass categories. Integration time, a measure of visual delay, was about 10 ms longer for V1 than LGN. In V1 there was a relatively broad distribution of integration times from 40-80 ms for simple cells and 60-100 ms for complex cells while in the LGN the distribution was narrower. {\textcopyright} 1996 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The individual properties of visual objects, like form or color, are represented in different areas in our visual cortex. In order to perceive one coherent object, its features have to be bound together. This was found to be achieved in cat and monkey brains by temporal correlation of the firing rates of neurons which code the same object. This firing rate is predominantly observed in the gamma frequency range (approx. 30-80 Hz, mainly around 40 Hz). In addition, it has been shown in humans that stimuli which flicker at gamma frequencies are processed faster by our brains than when they flicker at different frequencies. These effects could be due to neural oscillators, which preferably oscillate at certain frequencies, so-called resonance frequencies. It is also known that neurons in visual cortex respond to flickering stimuli at the frequency of the flickering light. If neural oscillators exist with resonance frequencies, they should respond more strongly to stimulation with their resonance frequency. We performed an experiment, where ten human subjects were presented flickering light at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz in 1-Hz steps. The event-related potentials exhibited steady-state oscillations at all frequencies up to at least 90 Hz. Interestingly, the steady-state potentials exhibited clear resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40 and 80 Hz. This could be a potential neural basis for gamma oscillations in binding experiments. The pattern of results resembles that of multiunit activity and local field potentials in cat visual cortex.},

This article reviews the literature on the alterations of gamma oscillations (about 30-80 Hz) during the course of neuropsychiatric disorders and relates them to a model for the functional role of these oscillations for memory matching. The synchronous firing of neurons in the gamma-band has been proposed to bind multiple features of an object, which are coded in a distributed manner in the brain, and is modulated by cognitive processes such as attention and memory. In certain neuropsychiatric disorders the gamma activity shows significant changes. In schizophrenic patients, negative symptoms correlate with a decrease of gamma responses, whereas a significant increase in gamma amplitudes is observed during positive symptoms such as hallucinations. A reduction is also observed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), whereas an increase is found in epileptic patients, probably reflecting both cortical excitation and perceptual distortions such as d{\'{e}}j{\`{a}} vu phenomena frequently observed in epilepsy. ADHD patients also exhibit increased gamma amplitudes.

All three functional mechanisms have been associated with brain activity in the gamma frequency range. It needs to be clarified, however, which subprocesses within the gamma frequency range relate to which perceptual or cognitive functions. In a visual discrimination task, we used Kanizsa figures whose constituent inducer disks need to be bound together to perceive the illusory contours. By a variation of the task requirements we manipulated the allocation of object selective attention as compared to a previous study. One out of four objects had to be detected. This detection process requires the comparison of two object dimensions (form and collinearity) with a working memory template. In order to get behavioural and electrophysiological measures, EEG and reaction times were recorded from 16 and 10 subjects, respectively. We demonstrated that the early evoked gamma activity reflects the process of allocating attention to a selected object as early as 50-150 ms after stimulus onset. We propose that the underlying mechanism is a high-speed memory comparison. In addition, we show that this early gamma activity also determines the reaction times needed to respond to the different stimuli.},

abstract = {We examined evoked and induced responses in event-related fields and gamma activity in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) during a visual classification task. The objective was to investigate the effects of target classification and the different levels of discrimination between certain stimulus features. We performed two experiments, which differed only in the subjects' task while the stimuli were identical. In Experiment 1, subjects responded by a button-press to rare Kanizsa squares (targets) among Kanizsa triangles and non-Kanizsa figures (standards). This task requires the processing of both stimulus features (collinearity and number of inducer disks). In Experiment 2, the four stimuli of Experiment 1 were used as standards and the occurrence of an additional stimulus without any feature overlap with the Kanizsa stimuli (a rare and highly salient red fixation cross) had to be detected. Discrimination of collinearity and number of inducer disks was not necessarily required for task performance. We applied a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis to the data and calculated topographical maps of the 40 Hz activity. The early evoked gamma activity (100-200 ms) in Experiment 1 was higher for targets as compared to standards. In Experiment 2, no significant differences were found in the gamma responses to the Kanizsa figures and non-Kanizsa figures. This pattern of results suggests that early evoked gamma activity in response to visual stimuli is affected by the targetness of a stimulus and the need to discriminate between the features of a stimulus.

abstract = {Groups of activated neurons typically synchronize in the gamma-frequency band (30-100. Hz), and gamma-band synchronization has been implicated in numerous cognitive functions. Those functions are ultimately expressed as behavior and therefore, functional gamma-band synchronization should be directly related to behavior. We recorded the magnetoencephalogram in human subjects and used a visual stimulus to induce occipital gamma-band activity. We found that the strength of this gamma-band activity at a given moment predicted the speed with which the subject was able to report a change in the stimulus. This predictive effect was restricted in time, frequency and space: It started only around 200. ms before the behaviorally relevant stimulus change, was present only between 50 and 80. Hz, and was significant only in bilateral middle occipital gyrus, while the peak of overall visually induced gamma-band activity was found in the calcarine sulcus. These results suggest that visually induced gamma-band activity is functionally relevant for the efficient transmission of stimulus change information to brain regions issuing the corresponding motor response. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Neuronal gamma-band (30-100 Hz) synchronization subserves fundamental functions in neuronal processing. However, different experimental approaches differ widely in their success in finding gamma-band activity. We aimed at linking animal and human studies of gamma-band activity and at preparing optimized methods for an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms and functions of gamma-band activity and gamma-band coherence in humans. In the first step described here, we maximized the signal-to-noise ratio with which we can observe visually induced gamma-band activity in human magnetoencephalographic recordings. We used a stimulus and task design that evoked strong gamma-band activity in animals and combined it with multi-taper methods for spectral analysis and adaptive spatial filtering for source analysis. With this approach, we found human visual gamma-band activity very reliably across subjects and across multiple recording sessions of a given subject. While increases in gamma-band activity are typically accompanied by decreases in alpha- and beta-band activity, the gamma-band enhancement was often the spectral component with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, some subjects demonstrated two clearly separate visually induced gamma bands, one around 40 Hz and another between 70 and 80 Hz. Gamma-band activity was sustained for the entire stimulation period, which was up to 3 s. The sources of gamma-band activity were in the calcarine sulcus in all subjects. The results localize human visual gamma-band activity in frequency, time and space and the described methods allow its further investigation with great sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A variety of ionic mechanisms support resonance and oscillation in neurons. Understanding the basic principles involved in the production of resonance allows for a simplified classification of these mechanisms. The characterization of resonance and frequency preference captures those essential properties of neurons that can serve as a substrate for coordinating network activity around a particular frequency in the brain.},

But the relationship between stimulation waveform and its impact on ongoing oscillations remains poorly understood and severely restrains the development of new paradigms. To address some aspects of this intricate problem, we combine computational and mathematical approaches, providing new insights into the influence of waveform of both low and high-frequency stimuli on synchronous neural activity. Using a cellular-based cortical microcircuit network model, we performed numerical simulations to test the influence of different waveforms on ongoing alpha oscillations, and derived a mean-field description of stimulation-driven dynamics to better understand the observed responses. Our analysis shows that high-frequency periodic stimulation translates into an effective transformation of the neurons' response function, leading to waveform-dependent changes in oscillatory dynamics and resting state activity. Moreover, we found that randomly fluctuating stimulation linearizes the neuron response function while constant input moves its activation threshold. Taken together, our findings establish a new theoretical framework in which stimulation waveforms impact neural systems at the population-scale through non-linear interactions.},

Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A$\beta$1-40 and A$\beta$1-42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice.

Recent data from recordings in animals and humans have suggested that gamma-frequency activity also has an important role in attention and both working and long-term memory. The involvement of gamma-band synchronization in various cognitive paradigms in humans is currently being investigated using intracranial and high-density electro- and magnetoencephalography recordings. Here, we discuss recent findings demonstrating human gamma-frequency activity associated with attention and memory in both sensory and non-sensory areas.

In two experiments, participants received 20-min of either $\alpha$-tACS (1 mA) or sham stimulation. Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded for 10-min before and after stimulation. tACS caused a larger power increase in the $\alpha$-band compared to sham. The variability of this effect was significantly predicted by measures derived from individual electric field modeling. Our results directly link electric field variability to variability of tACS outcomes, underline the importance of individualizing stimulation protocols, and provide a novel approach to analyze tACS effects in terms of dose-response relationships.},

This study explores how the time information inherent in large-scale electrocortical measures can be used to examine the functional relationships among the structures involved in emotional perception. Granger causality analysis was conducted on steady-state visual evoked potentials elicited by emotionally arousing pictures flickering at a rate of 10 Hz. This procedure allows one to examine the direction of neural connections. Participants viewed pictures that varied in emotional content, depicting people in neutral contexts, erotica, or interpersonal attack scenes. Results demonstrated increased coupling between visual and cortical areas when viewing emotionally arousing content. Specifically, intraparietal to inferotemporal and precuneus to calcarine connections were stronger for emotionally arousing picture content. Thus, we provide evidence for reentrant signal flow during emotional perception, which originates from higher tiers and enters lower tiers of visual cortex. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Previous work in this area attempted to circumvent this problem by constructing approximate linear and piecewise-linear mappings between standard brain templates (e.g. the MNI template) and Talairach space. These methods are limited in that they can only account for differences in overall brain size and orientation but cannot correct for the actual shape differences between the MNI template and the Talairach brain. In this paper we describe our work to digitize the Talairach atlas and generate a non-linear mapping between the Talairach atlas and the MNI template that attempts to compensate for the actual differences in shape between the two, resulting in more accurate coordinate transformations. We present examples in this paper and note that the method is available freely online as a Java applet. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ({\textless}100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.},

abstract = {Rhythms are a fundamental and defining feature of neuronal activity in animals including humans. This rhythmic brain activity interacts in complex ways with rhythms in the internal and external environment through the phenomenon of ‘neuronal entrainment', which is attracting increasing attention due to its suggested role in a multitude of sensory and cognitive processes. Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample the environment rhythmically, while others, like audition, are faced with mostly rhythmic inputs. Entrainment couples rhythmic brain activity to external and internal rhythmic events, serving fine-grained routing and modulation of external and internal signals across multiple spatial and temporal hierarchies. This interaction between a brain and its environment can be experimentally investigated and even modified by rhythmic sensory stimuli or invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques. We provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and propose a theoretical framework of how neuronal entrainment dynamically structures information from incoming neuronal, bodily and environmental sources. We discuss the different types of neuronal entrainment, the conceptual advances in the field, and converging evidence for general principles. Lakatos, Gross, and Thut review the evidence for neuronal entrainment by environmental, self-produced, and neuromodulatory rhythms, which leads them to propose a new, unifying account of the role of neuronal entrainment in the selection and structuring of information - taking into account the brain in a wider context.},

abstract = {Background: High-frequency (e.g., gamma 30 to 50 Hz) coherent neural activity has been postulated to underlie binding of independent neural assemblies and thus integrate processing across distributed neuronal networks to achieve a unified conscious experience. Prior studies suggest that gamma activity may play a role in perceptual mechanisms, but design limitations raise concerns. Thus, controversy exists as to the hypothesis that gamma activity is necessary for perceptual awareness. In addition, controversy exists as to whether the primary sensory cortices are involved directly in the mechanisms of conscious perception or just in processes prior to conscious awareness. Objective: To investigate the relation of gamma coherence and perception. Methods: Digital intracranial electrocorticographic recordings from implanted electrodes were obtained in six patients with intractable epilepsy during a simple somatosensory detection task for near-threshold stimuli applied to the contralateral hand. Signal analyses were then conducted using a quantitative approach that employed two-way Hanning digital bandpass filters to compute running correlations across pairs of channels at various time epochs for each patient and each perception state across multiple bandwidths. Results: Gamma coherence occurs in the primary somatosensory cortex approximately 150 to 300 milliseconds after contralateral hand stimuli that are perceived, but not for nonperceived stimuli, which did not differ in character/intensity or early somatosensory evoked potentials. Conclusion: The results are consistent with the possible direct involvement of primary sensory cortex in elemental awareness and with a role for gamma coherence in conscious perception.},

In addition, cortical alpha-activity was examined to test whether gamma-band activity might reflect changes in harmonics of alpha waves. Results indicate that induced gamma-band activity cannot be secondary to changes in the amplitude of alpha waves, since the latter would require both a similar time course of both frequency bands while stimuli are in motion and an identical topographical pattern.

abstract = {Increases in the power of neural oscillations in the gamma ({\textgreater}40Hz) band are a key signature of information processing in cortical neuronal networks. However, non-invasive detection of these very small oscillations is difficult due to the presence of potential artefacts (both muscular and ocular) in the same frequency band and requires highly optimised paradigms. Numerous studies have shown that the properties of visual gamma-band responses to simple pattern stimuli are highly tuned to the stimuli parameters used. The aim of this work was to compare gamma oscillation response properties across some of the more commonly used stimulus configurations. To do this, MEG and EEG recordings were made during the presentation of eight different stimulus types in a 2×2×2 design. For the first stimulus factor, "Type", the stimulus pattern was either an annulus grating or a square wave grating. For the second stimulus factor, "Field", stimuli were presented in either four visual field quadrants simultaneously or only in the lower left quadrant. Finally, for the "Move" factor, stimuli either drifted at 1.33°s-1 or were stationary. For MEG gamma band responses, the following main effects were observed, a) gamma-band power was increased for annular stimuli compared to square wave stimuli, b) gamma-band power was increased for full field stimuli compared to single quadrant stimuli and c) gamma-band power was larger for drifting compared to stationary stimuli and were of significantly higher frequency. For the detectors used, the signal to noise ratio was substantially higher for MEG than EEG. The advantages and disadvantages of the different types of stimulus types are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in the role gamma oscillations (∼40 Hz) play in visual information processing. Despite this interest, and in contrast to the classically studied visual evoked potential, surprisingly little is known about the intra-individual repeatability of induced gamma oscillations. Similarly, little is known about inter-individual variability in terms of gamma oscillation frequency, bandwidth and amplitude with no extant normative data for these parameters. The purpose of the current study was therefore to examine the repeatability of visual gamma oscillations and to provide the first normative data on them. Our results demonstrate that evoked responses were highly repeatable across recording sessions whereas for induced visual gamma oscillations a large amount of inter-individual variability existed in terms of frequency, bandwidth and amplitude. However, these parameters and the general morphology of the gamma band response were stable within the same individuals for at least 4 weeks. The high degree of individual variability in gamma oscillations for gamma amplitude, bandwidth and frequency suggests that between-group studies on gamma oscillations will be difficult, requiring relatively large amounts of data to detect differences. However, the high degree of individual repeatability for gamma oscillation frequency, bandwidth and amplitude suggests that these dependent variables will be well suited for repeated-measure designs such as pharmacological studies. A number of individuals are described which show clear evoked responses yet a near absence of gamma oscillations and vice versa suggesting dissociations between the generative mechanisms of these responses. Our results also demonstrate that gamma frequency tends to decline with age and is positively correlated with the thickness of the pericalcarine cortex. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The equation for the magnetic lead field for a given magnetoencephalography (MEG) channel is well known for arbitrary frequencies $\omega$ but is not directly applicable to MEG in the quasi-static approximation. In this paper we derive an equation for $\omega$ = 0 starting from the very definition of the lead field instead of using Helmholtz's reciprocity theorems. The results are (a) the transpose of the conductivity times the lead field is divergence-free, and (b) the lead field differs from the one in any other volume conductor by a gradient of a scalar function. Consequently, for a piecewise homogeneous and isotropic volume conductor, the lead field is always tangential at the outermost surface. Based on this theoretical result, we formulated a simple and fast method for the MEG forward calculation for one shell of arbitrary shape: we correct the corresponding lead field for a spherical volume conductor by a superposition of basis functions, gradients of harmonic functions constructed here from spherical harmonics, with coefficients fitted to the boundary conditions. The algorithm was tested for a prolate spheroid of realistic shape for which the analytical solution is known. For high order in the expansion, we found the solutions to be essentially exact and for reasonable accuracies much fewer multiplications are needed than in typical implementations of the boundary element methods. The generalization to more shells is straightforward.},

abstract = {The functional relevance of brain oscillations in the alpha frequency range (8–13 Hz) has been repeatedly investigated through the use of rhythmic visual stimulation. The underlying mechanism of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) measured in EEG during rhythmic stimulation, however, is not known. There are two hypotheses on the origin of SSVEPs: entrainment of brain oscillations and superposition of event-related responses (ERPs). The entrainment but not the superposition hypothesis justifies rhythmic visual stimulation as a means to manipulate brain oscillations, because superposition assumes a linear summation of single responses, independent from ongoing brain oscillations. Here, we stimulated participants with a rhythmic flickering light of different frequencies and intensities. We measured entrainment by comparing the phase coupling of brain oscillations stimulated by rhythmic visual flicker with the oscillations induced by arrhythmic jittered stimulation, varying the time, stimulation frequency, and intensity conditions. In line with a theoretical concept of entrainment (the so called Arnold tongue), we found the phase coupling to be more pronounced with increasing stimulation intensity as well as at stimulation frequencies closer to each participant's intrinsic frequency. Only inside the Arnold tongue did the conditions significantly differ from the jittered stimulation. Furthermore, even in a single sequence of an SSVEP, we found non-linear features (intermittency of phase locking) that contradict the linear summation of single responses, as assumed by the superposition hypothesis. Our findings provide unequivocal evidence that visual rhythmic stimulation entrains brain oscillations, thus validating the approach of rhythmic stimulation as a manipulation of brain oscillations.},

abstract = {Gamma (30-80 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) oscillations such as those displayed by in vitro hippocampal (CA1) slice preparations and by in vivo neocortical EEGs often occur successively, with a spontaneous transition between them. In the gamma rhythm, pyramidal cells fire together with the interneurons, while in the beta rhythm, pyramidal cells fire on a subset of cycles of the interneurons. It is shown that gamma and beta rhythms have different properties with respect to creation of cell assemblies. In the presence of heterogeneous inputs to the pyramidal cells, the gamma rhythm creates an assembly of firing pyramidal cells from cells whose drive exceeds a threshold. During the gamma to beta transition, a slow outward potassium current is activated, and as a result the cell assembly vanishes. The slow currents make each of the pyramidal cells fire with a beta rhythm, but the field potential of the network still displays a gamma rhythm. Hebbian changes of connections among the pyramidal cells give rise to a beta rhythm, and the cell assemblies are recovered with a temporal separation between cells firing in different cycles. We present experimental evidence showing that such a separation can occur in hippocampal slices.},

abstract = {Gamma oscillations are generated in networks of inhibitory fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons and pyramidal cells. In animals, gamma frequency is modulated by the velocity of visual motion; the effect of velocity has not been evaluated in humans. In this work, we have studied velocity-related modulations of gamma frequency in children using MEG/EEG. We also investigated whether such modulations predict the prominence of the “spatial suppression” effect (Tadin D, Lappin JS, Gilroy LA, Blake R. Nature 424: 312-315, 2003) that is thought to depend on cortical center-surround inhibitory mechanisms. MEG/EEG was recorded in 27 normal boys aged 8–15 yr while they watched high-contrast black-and-white annular gratings drifting with velocities of 1.2, 3.6, and 6.0°/s and performed a simple detection task. The spatial suppression effect was assessed in a separate psychophysical experiment. MEG gamma oscillation frequency increased while power decreased with increasing velocity of visual motion. In EEG, the effects were less reliable. The frequencies of the velocity-specific gamma peaks were 64.9, 74.8, and 87.1 Hz for the slow, medium, and fast motions, respectively. The frequency of the gamma response elicited during slow and medium velocity of visual motion decreased with subject age, whereas the range of gamma frequency modulation by velocity increased with age. The frequency modulation range predicted spatial suppression even after controlling for the effect of age. We suggest that the modulation of the MEG gamma frequency by velocity of visual motion reflects excitability of cortical inhibitory circuits and can be used to investigate their normal and pathological development in the human brain.},

The generality of this mechanism is unclear, however, as previous studies have focused on pairs of neurons with overlapping or collinear receptive fields. By sampling more broadly and employing stimuli that contain partially occluded objects, we have conducted a more incisive test of the binding by synchrony hypothesis in area MT. We find that synchrony in spiking activity shows little dependence on feature grouping, whereas gamma band synchrony in field potentials can be significantly stronger when features are grouped. However, these changes in gamma band synchrony are small relative to the variability of synchrony across recording sites and do not provide a robust population signal for feature grouping. Moreover, these effects are reduced when stimulus differences nearby the receptive fields are eliminated using partial occlusion. Our findings suggest that synchrony does not constitute a general mechanism of visual feature binding. Copyright {\textcopyright}2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The role of gamma-band (typically 30-100. Hz) oscillations in visual processing is a topic of increasing interest. One hypothesis is that gamma oscillations reflect the action of GABAergic inhibitory processes in the visual cortex responsible for surround-suppression. Evidence from primate neurophysiology [Gieselmann {\&} Thiele, A., 2008. European Journal of Neuroscience 28, 447-459.] suggests that the amplitude of the gamma-band response increases as a visual grating stimulus expands outside of the classical receptive field into the inhibitory surround; with the amplitude of the response increasing, and the frequency of the response decreasing, monotonically with stimulus size. In this study, we tested the relationship between the gamma-band response and the size of visual grating stimuli in humans using MEG. In two initial experiments we found that, while the absolute magnitude of the gamma-band response varied considerably across participants, in all cases the amplitude of the response had a monotonically increasing relationship with size. In contrast, we did not find any relationship between the frequency of the response and the size of the stimulus. Previously, the frequency of the visual gamma-band response has been found to correlate across individuals with the surface area of cortical area V1 [Schwarzkopf et al., 2012. Journal of Neuroscience 32, 1507-12.] We, however, were unable to find any correlation between the frequency or the magnitude of the gamma-band response and the dimensions of V1 cortical gray matter as measured from participants' MR images. Consistent with a saturation of the gamma-band response found for some individuals in the first two experiments, in a third experiment we found that the magnitude of the response to our largest stimulus (8°) was less than that predicted from the response to the stimulus' parts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The role or significance of this broadband high-gamma activity is unclear. One hypothesis states that high-gamma oscillations serve just like gamma oscillations, operating at a higher frequency and consequently at a faster timescale. Another hypothesis states that high-gamma power is related to spiking activity. Because gamma power and spiking activity tend to co-vary during most stimulus manipulations (such as contrast modulations) or cognitive tasks (such as attentional modulation), it is difficult to dissociate these two hypotheses. We studied the relationship between high-gamma power, gamma rhythm, and spiking activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys while varying the stimulus size, which increased the gamma power but decreased the firing rate, permitting a dissociation. We found that gamma power became anti-correlated with the high-gamma power, suggesting that the two phenomena are distinct and have different origins. On the other hand, high-gamma power remained tightly correlated with spiking activity under a wide range of stimulus manipulations. We studied this relationship using a signal processing technique called Matching Pursuit and found that action potentials are associated with sharp transients in the LFP with broadband power, which is visible at frequencies as low as {\~{}}50 Hz. These results distinguish broadband high-gamma activity from gamma rhythms as an easily obtained and reliable electrophysiological index of neuronal firing near the microelectrode. Further, they highlight the importance of making a careful dissociation between gamma rhythms and spike-related transients that could be incorrectly decomposed as rhythms using traditional signal processing methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Ray, Maunsell.},

To test this idea, we recorded from macaque V1 and V2 simultaneously while presenting gratings of varying contrast.

Results of several experiments in animals provide support for this idea (see, for example, refs 4-10). In humans, gamma oscillations have been described both on the scalp (measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) and in intracortical recordings, but no direct participation of synchrony in a cognitive task has been demonstrated so far. Here we record electrical brain activity from subjects who are viewing ambiguous visual stimuli (perceived either as faces or as meaningless shapes). We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that only face perception induces a long-distance pattern of synchronization, corresponding to the moment of perception itself and to the ensuing motor response. A period of strong desynchronization marks the transition between the moment of perception and the motor response. We suggest that this desynchronization reflects a process of active uncoupling of the underlying neural ensembles that is necessary to proceed from' one cognitive state to another.},

abstract = {A fundamental task of vision is to group the image elements that belong to one object and to segregate them from other objects and the background. This review provides a conceptual framework of how perceptual grouping may be implemented in the visual cortex. According to this framework, two mechanisms are responsible for perceptual grouping: base-grouping and incremental grouping. Base-groupings are coded by single neurons tuned to multiple features, like the combination of a color and an orientation. They are computed rapidly because they reflect the selectivity of feedforward connections. However, not all conceivable feature combinations are coded by dedicated neurons. Therefore, a second, flexible form of grouping is required called incremental grouping. Incremental grouping enhances the responses of neurons coding features that are bound in perception, but it takes more time than does base-grouping because it relies also on horizontal and feedback connections. The modulation of neuronal response strength during incremental grouping has a correlate in psychology because attention is directed to those features that are labeled by the enhanced neuronal response.

abstract = {Recent experimental results in the visual cortex of cats and monkeys have suggested an important role for synchronization of neuronal activity on a millisecond time scale. Synchronization has been found to occur selectively between neuronal responses to related image components. This suggests that not only the firing rates of neurons but also the relative timing of their action potentials is used as a coding dimension. Thus, a powerful relational code would be available, in addition to the rate code, for the representation of perceptual objects. This could alleviate difficulties in the simultaneous representation of multiple objects. In this article we present a set of theoretical arguments and predictions concerning the mechanisms that could group neurons responding to related image components into coherently active aggregates. Synchrony is likely to be mediated by synchronizing connections; we introduce the concept of an interaction skeleton to refer to the subset of synchronizing connections that are rendered effective by a particular stimulus configuration. If the image is segmented into objects, these objects can typically be segmented further into their constituent parts. The synchronization behavior of neurons that represent the various image components may accurately reflect this hierarchical clustering. We propose that the range of synchronizing interactions is a dynamic parameter of the cortical network, so that the grain of the resultant grouping process may be adapted to the actual behavioral requirements. It can be argued that different aspects of purposeful behavior rely on separable processes by which sensory input is transformed into adjustments of motor activity. Indeed, neurophysiological evidence has suggested separate processing streams originating in the primary visual cortex for object identification and sensorimotor coordination. However, such a separation calls for a mechanism that avoids interference effects in the presence of multiple objects, or when multiple motor programs are simultaneously prepared. In this article we suggest that synchronization between responses of neurons in both the visual cortex and in areas that are involved in response selection and execution might allow for a selective routing of sensory information to the appropriate motor program.},

We now provide a third version, AAL3, which adds a number of brain areas not previously defined, but of interest in many neuroimaging investigations. The 26 new areas in the third version are subdivision of the anterior cingulate cortex into subgenual, pregenual and supracallosal parts; subdivision of the thalamus into 15 parts; the nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, red nucleus, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. The new atlas is available as a toolbox for SPM, and can be used with MRIcron.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of communication through coherence proposes that coherent or synchronous oscillations in connected neural systems can promote communication. It has been applied mainly to how oscillations interact in connected networks. We tested by simulations whether information transmission about an external stimulus from one network to a second network is influenced by gamma oscillations, by whether the oscillations are coherent, and by their phase. Gamma oscillations were induced by increasing the relative conductance of AMPA to NMDA excitatory synapses. It was found that small associative connection strengths between the networks were sufficient to produce information transmission (measured by Shannon mutual information) such that the second attractor network took the correct decision based on the state of the first network. Although gamma oscillations were present in both networks, the synaptic connections sufficient for perfect information transmission about the stimulus presented to the network (100{\%} correct, 1bit of information) were insufficiently strong to produce coherence, or phase-locking, between the two networks; this only occurred when the synaptic strengths between the networks were increased by {\textgreater}10×. Further, the phase of the oscillations between the networks did not influence the information transmission or its speed at these connection strengths. Moreover, information transmission was as good when the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio was reduced to its normal value, and oscillations were not present. Similar results were found when the second network was not an attractor decision-making network. Thus information transmission can occur before synapses have been made sufficiently strong to produce coherence. {\textcopyright} 2012 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We show that there is a stronger frequency entrainment in magnetoencephalogram than in electroencephalogram recordings in all volunteers, which indicates a possible tangential brain activity underlying the dominant entrainment effect.

These analyses revealed that the same pattern of gamma-band (28-100 Hz) oscillatory activity that predicts successful memory formation at item encoding - increased gamma power in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and left temporal lobe - reemerges at retrieval to distinguish correct from incorrect responses. The timing of these oscillatory effects suggests that self-cued memory retrieval begins in the hippocampus and then spreads to the cortex. Thus, retrieval of true, as compared with false, memories induces a distinct pattern of gamma oscillations, possibly reflecting recollection of contextual information associated with past experience. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 Association for Psychological Science.},

In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is to understand how the brain encodes the intensity of sensory features. We used whole-head magnetoencephalography to investigate whether frequency-specific neuronal activity in the human visual cortex is systematically modulated by the intensity of an elementary sensory feature such as visual motion. Visual stimulation induced a tonic increase of neuronal activity at frequencies above 50 Hz. In order to define a functional frequency band of neuronal activity, we parametrically investigated which frequency band displays the strongest monotonic increase of responses with strength of visual motion. Consistently in all investigated subjects, this analysis resulted in a functional frequency band in the high gamma range from about 60 to 100 Hz in which activity reliably increased with visual motion strength. Using distributed source reconstruction, we found that this increase of high-frequency neuronal activity originates from several extrastriate cortical regions specialized in motion processing. We conclude that high-frequency activity in the human visual motion pathway may be relevant for encoding the intensity of visual motion signals. {\textcopyright} The Author 2006.

@article{singer2009distributed,
abstract = {The cerebral cortex presents itself as a distributed dynamical system with the characteristics of a small world network. The neuronal correlates of cognitive and executive processes often appear to consist of the coordinated activity of large assemblies of widely distributed neurons. These features require mechanisms for the selective routing of signals across densely interconnected networks, the flexible and context dependent binding of neuronal groups into functionally coherent assemblies and the task and attention dependent integration of subsystems. In order to implement these mechanisms, it is proposed that neuronal responses should convey two orthogonal messages in parallel. They should indicate (1) the presence of the feature to which they are tuned and (2) with which other neurons (specific target cells or members of a coherent assembly) they are communicating. The first message is encoded in the discharge frequency of the neurons (rate code) and it is proposed that the second message is contained in the precise timing relationships between individual spikes of distributed neurons (temporal code). It is further proposed that these precise timing relations are established either by the timing of external events (stimulus locking) or by internal timing mechanisms. The latter are assumed to consist of an oscillatory modulation of neuronal responses in different frequency bands that cover a broad frequency range from {\textless}2 Hz (delta) to {\textgreater}40 Hz (gamma) and ripples. These oscillations limit the communication of cells to short temporal windows whereby the duration of these windows decreases with oscillation frequency. Thus, by varying the phase relationship between oscillating groups, networks of functionally cooperating neurons can be flexibly configurated within hard wired networks. Moreover, by synchronizing the spikes emitted by neuronal populations, the saliency of their responses can be enhanced due to the coincidence sensitivity of receiving neurons in very much the same way as can be achieved by increasing the discharge rate. Experimental evidence will be reviewed in support of the coexistence of rate and temporal codes. Evidence will also be provided that disturbances of temporal coding mechanisms are likely to be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms in schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Although the mammalian neocortex has a clear laminar organization, layer-specific neuronal computations remain to be uncovered. Several studies suggest that gamma band activity in primary visual cortex (V1) is produced in granular and superficial layers and is associated with the processing of visual input [1-3]. Oscillatory alpha band activity in deeper layers has been proposed to modulate neuronal excitability associated with changes in arousal and cognitive factors [4-7]. To investigate the layer-specific interplay between these two phenomena, we characterized the coupling between alpha and gamma band activity of the local field potential in V1 of the awake macaque. Using multicontact laminar electrodes to measure spontaneous signals simultaneously from all layers of V1, we found a robust coupling between alpha phase in the deeper layers and gamma amplitude in granular and superficial layers. Moreover, the power in the two frequency bands was anticorrelated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate robust interlaminar cross-frequency coupling in the visual cortex, supporting the view that neuronal activity in the alpha frequency range phasically modulates processing in the cortical microcircuit in a top-down manner [7]. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Prestimulus oscillatory neural activity in the visual cortex has large consequences for percepti on and can be influenced by top-down control from higher-order brain regions. Making a causal claim about the mechanistic role of oscillatory activity requires that oscillations be directly manipulated independently of cognitive instructions. There are indications that a direct manipulation, or entrainment, of visual alpha activity is possible through visual stimulation. However, three important questions remain: (1) Can the entrained alpha activity be endogenously maintained in the absence of continuous stimulation?; (2) Does entrainment of alpha activity reflect a global or a local process?; and (3) Does the entrained alpha activity influence perception? To address these questions, we presented human subjects with rhythmic stimuli in one visual hemifield, and arhythmic stimuli in the other. After rhythmic entrainment, we found a periodic pattern in detection performance of near-threshold targets specific to the entrained hemifield. Using magnetoencephalograhy to measure ongoing brain activity, we observed strong alpha activity contralateral to the rhythmic stimulation outlasting the stimulation by several cycles. This entrained alpha activity was produced locally in early visual cortex, as revealed by source analysis. Importantly, stronger alpha entrainment predicted a stronger phasic modulation of detection performance in the entrained hemifield. These findings argue for a cortically focal entrainment of ongoing alpha oscillations by visual stimulation, with concomitant consequences for perception. Our results support the notion that oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band provides a causal mechanism for the temporal organization of visual perception. {\textcopyright} 2014 the authors.},

In the present review, we first summarize the current status of the research on gamma entrainment in mouse models of AD and human AD patients. Then, we suggest transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as an alternative brain stimulation technique and review the recent literature on the effects of gamma tACS in healthy volunteers and neuropsychiatric diseases to document the efficacy of gamma tACS in improving cognitive functions. We discuss several advantages of tACS compared to rhythmic sensory stimulation for the entrainment of gamma oscillations in the human brain and emphasize the need for more clinical studies applying tACS to drive gamma oscillations and, in turn, to improve cognitive functioning not only in AD but also in patients suffering from other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

The evoked potentials were analysed by convoluting the signal for each subject and each stimulation type by Gabor wavelets centred from 28 up to 46 Hz, providing a continuous measure of frequency‐specific power over time. A first peak of activity was found around 38 Hz and 100 ms with a maximum at electrode Cz in each experimental condition. A second peak of activity occurred around 30 Hz and 230 ms, with a maximum at O1 in response to the real triangle and a maximum at Cz in the case of the illusory triangle. At 100 ms we did not find any variations of the gamma‐band component of the evoked potential with stimulation type, but the power of the 30 Hz component of the evoked potential between 210 and 290 ms differed from noise only in the case of a coherent triangle, no matter whether real or illusory. We thus found a 30 Hz component whose power correlates with stimulus coherency, which supports the hypothesis of a functional role of high‐frequency synchronization in feature binding. Moreover, this correlation seemed specific to the gamma‐frequency range, as neither the power of the low‐frequency components (0–25 Hz) nor the power of the electromyogram range components (60–80 Hz) showed the same effect.

Its functional role in human visual cognition turns out to be much broader, especially when attention, memory or awareness are concerned. Induced gamma oscillations are thus not related to a single cognitive function, and are probably better understood in terms of a population mechanism taking advantage of the neuron's fine temporal tuning: the 10-30 ms time precision imposed by gamma-band rhythms could favor the selective transmission of synchronized information (attention) and foster synaptic plasticity (memory). Besides, gamma oscillatory synchrony also seems related to the emergence of visual awareness. The recent discovery that gamma oscillations could appear simultaneously in distinct areas at distinct frequencies and with different functional correlates further suggests the existence of a flexible multiplexing schema, integrating frequency bands within the gamma range but also at lower frequency bands. Understanding how and when oscillations at different frequencies interact has become a major challenge for the years to come.},

The task of the subject was to count the occurrences of a curved illusory triangle. A time-frequency analysis of single-trial EEG data recorded from eight human subjects was performed to characterize phase-locked as well as non-phase-locked high-frequency activities. We found an early phase-locked 40 Hz component, maximal at electrodes Cz-C4, which does not vary with stimulation type. We describe a second 40 Hz component, appearing around 280 msec, that is not phase-locked to stimulus onset. This component is stronger in response to a coherent triangle, whether real or illusory: it could reflect, therefore, a mechanism of feature binding based on high-frequency synchronization. Because both the illusory and the real triangle are more target-like, it could also correspond to an oscillatory mechanism for testing the match between stimulus and target. At the same latencies, the low-frequency evoked response components phase-locked to stimulus onset behave differently, suggesting that low- and high-frequency activities have different functional roles.},

Non-invasive measurements using electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) have revealed that high frequency neural signals are heritable and manifest changes with age as well as in neuropsychiatric illnesses. Despite the extensive use of EEG/MEG-measured neural oscillations in basic and clinical research, studies demonstrating test-retest reliability of power and frequency measures of neural signals remain scarce. Here, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of visually induced gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations derived from sensor and source signals acquired over two MEG sessions. The study required participants (N = 13) to detect the randomly occurring stimulus acceleration while viewing a moving concentric grating. Sensor and source MEG measures of gamma-band activity yielded comparably strong reliability (average intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.861). Peak stimulus-induced gamma frequency (53-72 Hz) yielded the highest measures of stability (ICCsensor = 0.940; ICCsource = 0.966) followed by spectral signal change (ICCsensor = 0.890; ICCsource = 0.893) and peak frequency bandwidth (ICCsensor = 0.856; ICCsource = 0.622). Furthermore, source-reconstruction significantly improved signal-to-noise for spectral amplitude of gamma activity compared to sensor estimates. Our assessments highlight that both sensor and source derived estimates of visually induced gamma-band oscillations from MEG signals are characterized by high test-retest reliability, with source derived oscillatory measures conferring an improvement in the stability of peak-frequency estimates. Importantly, our finding of high test-retest reliability supports the feasibility of pharma-MEG studies and longitudinal aging or clinical studies.},

To place these data in a wider context, the major afferent inputs to and efferent outputs from each of the layers are discussed first.},

abstract = {SYNCHRONOUS neuronal oscillations in the 30-70 Hz range, known as gamma oscillations, occur in the cortex of many species. This synchronization can occur over large distances, and in some cases over multiple cortical areas and in both hemispheres; it has been proposed to underlie the binding of several features into a single perceptual entity. The mechanism by which coherent oscillations are generated remains unclear, because they often show zero or near-zero phase lags over long distances, whereas much greater phase lags would be expected from the slow speed of axonal conduction. We have previously shown that interneuron networks alone can generate gamma oscillations; here we propose a simple model to explain how an interconnected chain of such networks can generate coherent oscillations. The model incorporates known properties of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons; it predicts that when excitation of interneurons reaches a level sufficient to induce pairs of spikes in rapid succession (spike doublets), the network will generate gamma oscillations that are synchronized on a millisecond time-scale from one end of the chain to the other. We show that in rat hippocampal slices interneurons do indeed fire spike doublets under conditions in which gamma oscillations are synchronized over several millimetres, whereas they fire single spikes under other conditions. Thus, known properties of neurons and local synaptic circuits can account for tightly synchronized oscillations in large neuronal ensembles.},

In the first part, we present recent results derived from animal experiments and mathematical simulations that provide novel explanations and mechanisms for zero and nero-zero phase lag synchronization. In the second part, we shall discuss the role of neural synchrony for expectancy during perceptual organization and its role in conscious experience. This will be followed by evidence that indicates that in addition to supporting conscious cognition, neural synchrony is abnormal in major brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.

@article{van2013visual,
abstract = {The peak frequency of neuronal gamma-band synchronization has received much attention in recent years. Gamma peak frequency shifts to higher frequency values for higher contrast, faster moving, and attended stimuli. In monkey V1, gamma peak frequency for a drifting grating is higher for a parafoveal as compared to an eccentric stimulus (Lima et al., 2010). This effect might be due to the cortical magnification factor: the higher cortical magnification for parafoveal stimuli increases the velocity with which the cortical representations of the moving grating stripes move across the cortical surface. Since faster moving stimuli lead to higher gamma frequency, a faster moving cortical representation might do the same. This explanation predicts that the eccentricity effect on gamma peak frequency is absent for stationary stimuli. To test this, we investigated the effect of eccentricity on gamma peak frequency by recording magnetoencephalography in human subjects while they viewed moving or stationary gratings. We found that both the moving and the stationary stimuli induced lower peak frequencies for larger eccentricities, arguing against an explanation based on the cortical magnification factor. We further investigated whether this eccentricity effect was explained by differences in the size or the spatial frequency of the expected cortical activation. Neither of those explained the eccentricity effect. We propose that the different stimulus and top-down factors leading to higher gamma peak frequency all result in higher stimulus salience, that salience is translated into gamma peak frequency, and that gamma peak frequency might subserve the preferential processing of neuronal activity induced by salient stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The possible functions of such rhythmic synchronization in neural coding, however, remain largely speculative. In the locust, odours evoke activity in dynamic (evolving) ensembles of transiently synchronized neurons. We report here that the active neurons composing these ensembles change in a stimulus-specific manner and with a high degree of reliability on a cycle-by-cycle basis during an odour response. Hence, information about an odour is contained not only in the neural assembly active at each oscillation cycle, but also in the precise temporal sequence in which these assemblies are updated during an odour response. Neural coding with oscillations thus allows combinatorial representations in time as well as in space.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that this selective neuronal modulation relies on rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales: attention selectively synchronizes the rhythmic responses of those neurons that are tuned to the spatial and featural attributes of the attended sensory input. The strength of synchronization is thereby functionally related to perceptual accuracy and behavioural efficiency. Complementing this synchronization at a local level, attention has recently been demonstrated to regulate which locally synchronized neuronal groups phase-synchronize their rhythmic activity across long-range connections. These results point to a general computational role for selective synchronization in dynamically controlling which neurons communicate information about sensory inputs effectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity, attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70 Hz)1-11. Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas1,12-16. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other, thek reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour, reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Studying the laminar pattern of neural activity is crucial for understanding the processing of neural signals in the cerebral cortex. We measured neural population activity [multiunit spike activity (MUA) and local field potential, LFP] in Macaque primary visual cortex (V1) in response to drifting grating stimuli. Sustained visually driven MUA was at an approximately constant level across cortical depth in V1. However, sustained, visually driven, local field potential power, which was concentrated in the $\gamma$-band (20-60 Hz), was greatest at the cortical depth corresponding to corticocortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B. $\gamma$-band power also tends to be more sustained in the output layers. Overall, cortico-cortical output layers accounted for 67{\%} of total $\gamma$-band activity in V1, whereas 56{\%} of total spikes evoked by drifting gratings were from layers 2, 3, and 4B. The high-resolution layer specificity of $\gamma$-band power, the laminar distribution of MUA and $\gamma$-band activity, and their dynamics imply that neural activity in V1 is generated by laminar-specific mechanisms. In particular, visual responses of MUA and $\gamma$-band activity in cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B seem to be strongly influenced by laminar-specific recurrent circuitry and/or feedback.},

abstract = {Frequency tagging has been widely used to study the role of visual selective attention. Presenting a visual stimulus flickering at a specific frequency generates so-called steady-state visually evoked responses. However, frequency tagging is mostly done at lower frequencies ({\textless}30 Hz). This produces a visible flicker, potentially interfering with both perception and neuronal oscillations in the theta, alpha and beta band. To overcome these problems, we used a newly developed projector with a 1440 Hz refresh rate allowing for frequency tagging at higher frequencies. We asked participants to perform a cued spatial attention task in which imperative pictorial stimuli were presented at 63 Hz or 78 Hz while measuring whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found posterior sensors to show a strong response at the tagged frequency. Importantly, this response was enhanced by spatial attention. Furthermore, we reproduced the typical modulations of alpha band oscillations, i.e., decrease in the alpha power contralateral to the attentional cue. The decrease in alpha power and increase in frequency tagged signal with attention correlated over subjects. We hereby provide proof-of-principle for the use of high-frequency tagging to study sensory processing and neuronal excitability associated with attention.},
